<H1>WWW 2017 Tutorial: Contructing Structured Information Networks from Massive Text Corpora</H1>
<H2>Time: 9-10:30am & 11-12:30pm, April 3.</H2>
<H2>Location: Meeting Room 10.</H2>
The success of data mining technology is largely attributed to the efficient and effective analysis of structured data. The construction of a well-structured, machine-actionable database from unstructured or loosely-structured data sources is often the premise of consequent applications. Although the majority of existing data generated in our society is unstructured, big data leads to big opportunities to uncover structures of real-world entities, attributes, relations from massive text corpora. By integrating these semantic-rich structures with other inter-related structured data (e.g., product specification, user transaction log), one can construct a powerful StructNet as a conceptual abstraction of the original text corpora. The uncovered StructNets will facilitate browsing information and inferring knowledge that are otherwise locked in the text corpora. Computational machines can effectively perform algorithmic analysis at a large scale over these StructNets, and apply the new insights and knowledge to improve human productivity in various downstream tasks.
